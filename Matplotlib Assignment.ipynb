    "# Question no. 1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer no.1\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of structured data stored electronically in a computer system. It allows for efficient data storage, retrieval, updating, and management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "1. Relational database management systems (RDBMS)\n",
    "2. Use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data\n",
    "3. Data is stored in tables with fixed rows and columns\n",
    "4. Follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)\n",
    "5. Best for complex queries and transactions\n",
    "6. Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "1. Non-relational or distributed database systems\n",
    "2. No standard query language (though many have their own)\n",
    "3. Flexible schema design (document, key-value, graph, column-family)\n",
    "4. Follow CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance)\n",
    "5. Best for handling large volumes of unstructured data\n",
    "6. Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question no. 2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer no.2\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "DDL (Data Definition Language) is a subset of SQL used to define and modify database structures. It deals with schema creation and modification rather than data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key DDL commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE: Used to create new database objects like tables, views, indexes, etc.\n",
    "   Example: \n",
    "   CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "       EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       FirstName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       LastName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       Department VARCHAR(50)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP: Used to delete entire database objects.\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   DROP TABLE Employees;  -- Deletes the entire Employees table\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER: Used to modify existing database objects.\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ALTER TABLE Employees ADD COLUMN Email VARCHAR(100);  -- Adds a new column\n",
    "   ALTER TABLE Employees MODIFY COLUMN Department VARCHAR(100);  -- Modifies column\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE: Used to remove all records from a table while keeping the structure intact.\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;  -- Removes all data but keeps the table structure\n",
    "\n",
    "These commands are essential for database administrators to manage the structure of databases as requirements evolve.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question no. 3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer no.3\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "DML (Data Manipulation Language) is a subset of SQL used for managing data within database objects. It deals with inserting, updating, and deleting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key DML commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INSERT: Adds new records to a table.\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department)\n",
    "   VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'IT'),\n",
    "          (2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'HR');\n",
    "\n",
    "2. UPDATE: Modifies existing records in a table.\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   UPDATE Employees\n",
    "   SET Department = 'Finance'\n",
    "   WHERE EmployeeID = 2;  -- Changes Jane's department to Finance\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DELETE: Removes specific records from a table.\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   DELETE FROM Employees\n",
    "   WHERE EmployeeID = 1;  -- Removes John's record from the table\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike DDL which affects database structure, DML operations affect the actual data stored in the database.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question no. 4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer no.4\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "DQL (Data Query Language) is a subset of SQL used for querying and retrieving data from databases. The primary DQL command is SELECT.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT Statement:\n",
    "The SELECT statement retrieves data from one or more tables. It can include filtering, sorting, grouping, and joining operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Syntax:\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE condition\n",
    "GROUP BY column\n",
    "HAVING condition\n",
    "ORDER BY column\n",
    "LIMIT number;\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simple query:\n",
    "   SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. With filtering:\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'IT';\n",
    "\n",
    "3. With sorting:\n",
    "   SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName ASC;\n",
    "\n",
    "4. With aggregation:\n",
    "   SELECT Department, COUNT(*) as EmployeeCount\n",
    "   FROM Employees\n",
    "   GROUP BY Department;\n",
    "\n",
    "5. With joining tables:\n",
    "   SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, d.DepartmentName\n",
    "   FROM Employees e\n",
    "   JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT is the most frequently used SQL command as it forms the basis for data retrieval in relational databases.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question no. 5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer no.5\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Primary Key and Foreign Key are important relational database concepts that help maintain data integrity and establish relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key:\n",
    "- A column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table\n",
    "- Cannot contain NULL values\n",
    "- Each table can have only one primary key\n",
    "- Enforces entity integrity (each row is uniquely identifiable)\n",
    "- Example: EmployeeID in an Employees table\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "- A column or set of columns that refers to the primary key in another table\n",
    "- Creates a relationship between two tables\n",
    "- Ensures referential integrity (values must exist in the referenced table)\n",
    "- Can contain NULL values (unless constrained otherwise)\n",
    "- Example: DepartmentID in Employees table that references DepartmentID in Departments table\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Departments (\n",
    "    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    DepartmentName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    FirstName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    LastName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    DepartmentID INT,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- DepartmentID is the primary key in Departments table\n",
    "- DepartmentID in Employees table is a foreign key referencing Departments table\n",

    "# Question no. 6. Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.\n",
    "\n",
