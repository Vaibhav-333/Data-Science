    "# Question 1: Purpose and Working of GridSearchCV\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "- Exhaustively searches all specified hyperparameter combinations\n",
    "- Finds optimal hyperparameters for ML models\n",
    "- Performs cross-validation to evaluate each combination\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "1. Define parameter grid (e.g., {'C': [1,10], 'kernel': ['linear','rbf']})\n",
    "2. Evaluates all possible combinations\n",
    "3. Uses k-fold cross-validation for each combination\n",
    "4. Selects parameters with best performance metric\n",
    "5. Returns trained model with best parameters\n",

    "# Question 2: GridSearchCV vs RandomizedSearchCV\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Key Differences:\n",
    "1. Search Strategy:\n",
    "   - GridSearch: Exhaustive search\n",
    "   - Randomized: Random sampling of parameter space\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Computation:\n",
    "   - GridSearch: More computationally expensive\n",
    "   - Randomized: More efficient for large spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Coverage:\n",
    "   - GridSearch: Systematic but may miss optimal points\n",
    "   - Randomized: Better for exploring large spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Choose:\n",
    "- GridSearch: Small parameter spaces (<10 combinations)\n",
    "- RandomizedSearch: Large parameter spaces or limited compute resources\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 3: Data Leakage in Machine Learning\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "What is Data Leakage:\n",
    "- When information from outside training data influences model\n",
    "- Causes overly optimistic performance estimates\n",
    "- Leads to poor generalization in production\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- Using future data to predict past events\n",
    "- Including test set statistics in feature scaling\n",
    "- Preprocessing entire dataset before train-test split\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Problematic:\n",
    "- Inflates model performance metrics\n",
    "- Creates unrealistic expectations\n",
    "- Results in models that fail in real-world use\n",
