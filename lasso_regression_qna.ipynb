    "**Answer no. 3** -\n",

    "**Answer no. 7** -\n",
    "Yes, Lasso can handle multicollinearity to some extent. It tends to select one feature among the correlated group and shrink the rest to zero. However, it may be unstable in the presence of high multicollinearity. In such cases, **Elastic Net** (combination of L1 and L2) is preferred."
