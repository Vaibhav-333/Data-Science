    "# Question 1: Purpose of forward propagation\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Forward propagation is the process of passing input data through the neural network to generate predictions. It:\n",
    "1. Computes the network's output\n",
    "2. Transforms inputs through successive layers\n",
    "3. Enables comparison with true values (for loss calculation)\n",
    "4. Is essential for both training and inference\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 2: Mathematical implementation in single-layer network\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "For a single-layer network with input x, weights W, bias b, and activation f:\n",
    "z = W·x + b  # Weighted sum\n",
    "a = f(z)     # Activation output\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- x ∈ ℝⁿ (input vector)\n",
    "- W ∈ ℝᵐˣⁿ (weight matrix)\n",
    "- b ∈ ℝᵐ (bias vector)\n",
    "- f: activation function\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 3: Activation functions in forward propagation\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Activation functions:\n",
    "1. Introduce non-linearity between layers\n",
    "2. Transform weighted sums (z) to layer outputs (a)\n",
    "3. Enable learning complex patterns\n",
    "4. Applied element-wise to z values\n",
    "Example: a = ReLU(W·x + b)\n",

    "# Question 4: Role of weights and biases\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Weights (W):\n",
    "1. Determine connection strength between neurons\n",
    "2. Scalar multipliers for input features\n",
    "3. Learned during training\n",
    "\n",
    "Biases (b):\n",
    "1. Allow shifting activation function output\n",
    "2. Enable fitting when all inputs are zero\n",
    "3. Provide additional learnable parameters\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 5: Softmax in output layer\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Softmax function:\n",
    "1. Converts output scores to probabilities\n",
    "2. Ensures outputs sum to 1 (for classification)\n",
    "3. Highlights largest values while suppressing others\n",
    "Formula for class j: σ(z)ⱼ = eᶻʲ / ∑ₖ eᶻᵏ\n",
    "Used for:\n",
