    "# ==================== DATABASE SECTION ====================\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question no. 1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer no.1\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of structured data stored electronically in a computer system. It allows for efficient data storage, retrieval, updating, and management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "1. Relational database management systems (RDBMS)\n",
    "2. Use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data\n",
    "3. Data is stored in tables with fixed rows and columns\n",
    "4. Follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)\n",
    "5. Best for complex queries and transactions\n",
    "6. Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "1. Non-relational or distributed database systems\n",
    "2. No standard query language (though many have their own)\n",
    "3. Flexible schema design (document, key-value, graph, column-family)\n",
    "4. Follow CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance)\n",
    "5. Best for handling large volumes of unstructured data\n",
    "6. Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j\n",

    "# ==================== API SECTION ====================\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question no. 1. What is an API? Give an example where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer no.1\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. It defines how software components should interact and allows different systems to communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-life Example:\n",
    "- Weather Application: When you check weather on your smartphone, the app uses a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap API) to fetch current weather data from a remote server. The app sends a request to the API endpoint, which returns structured data (like temperature, humidity) that the app then displays to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other Examples:\n",
    "1. Payment Processing: Stripe/PayPal APIs for online payments\n",
    "2. Social Media Login: \"Login with Facebook/Google\" buttons\n",
    "3. Travel Booking: Aggregating flight data from multiple airlines\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question no. 2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer no.2\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Advantages of APIs:\n",
    "1. Efficiency: Faster development by reusing existing functionality\n",
    "2. Standardization: Consistent way to access services/data\n",
    "3. Security: Controlled access to data through authentication\n",
    "4. Scalability: Easier to scale distributed systems\n",
    "5. Innovation: Enables mashups and new services by combining APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of APIs:\n",
    "1. Dependency: Reliance on third-party services (if they go down, your app fails)\n",
    "2. Limitations: API providers may impose usage limits or restrictions\n",
    "3. Changes: API updates may break existing integrations\n",
    "4. Security Risks: Improper implementation can expose vulnerabilities\n",
    "5. Performance: Network latency in API calls affects response times\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question no. 3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer no.3\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Web API is a type of API specifically designed for web-based systems, typically using HTTP protocols for communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular API:\n",
    "- Can be any interface between software components\n",
    "- Includes local APIs (like OS APIs), library APIs, etc.\n",
    "- Communication can happen within a single machine\n",
    "- Various protocols can be used (not just HTTP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Web API:\n",
    "- Specifically designed for web applications\n",
    "- Uses HTTP/HTTPS protocols\n",
    "- Typically returns data in JSON or XML format\n",
    "- Client-server architecture over a network\n",
    "- Stateless in nature (in case of REST)\n",
    "- Examples: Twitter API, Google Maps API, Stripe API\n",
    "\n",
    "All Web APIs are APIs, but not all APIs are Web APIs.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question no. 4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer no.4\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "REST (Representational State Transfer):\n",
    "- Architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems\n",
    "- Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)\n",
    "- Stateless - each request contains all necessary information\n",
    "- Resources are identified by URIs\n",
    "- Typically uses JSON (though can use XML)\n",
    "- Lightweight and fast\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):\n",
    "- Protocol for exchanging structured information\n",
    "- Uses XML for message format\n",
    "- Relies on WSDL (Web Services Description Language)\n",
    "- Requires more bandwidth\n",
    "- Stateful operations possible\n",
    "- Built-in error handling\n",
    "- WS-* standards for security, transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "1. Complexity: More verbose and harder to implement\n",
    "2. Performance: XML parsing is slower than JSON\n",
    "3. Bandwidth: Larger message sizes due to XML\n",
    "4. Less flexible: Strict standards make changes difficult\n",
    "5. Steeper learning curve compared to REST\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",

    "   - SOAP: Standard protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Format:\n",
    "   - REST: Typically JSON (can use XML)\n",
    "   - SOAP: Only XML\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standards:\n",
    "   - REST: Uses HTTP standards (GET, POST, etc.)\n",
    "   - SOAP: Uses WS-* standards (WS-Security, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. State:\n",
    "   - REST: Stateless\n",
    "   - SOAP: Can be stateful\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Performance:\n",
    "   - REST: Faster due to lightweight payloads\n",
    "   - SOAP: Slower due to XML parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Caching:\n",
    "   - REST: Supports caching\n",
    "   - SOAP: No built-in caching\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Security:\n",
    "   - REST: Relies on HTTPS\n",
    "   - SOAP: Built-in WS-Security\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Use Cases:\n",
    "   - REST: Public APIs, web/mobile apps\n",
    "   - SOAP: Enterprise systems, financial services\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Bandwidth:\n",
    "   - REST: Requires less bandwidth\n",
    "   - SOAP: Requires more bandwidth\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Learning Curve:\n",
